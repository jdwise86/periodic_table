Submission for the freeCodeCamp Relational Database project.

This is a Bash script that takes a query as an argument and searches a PostgreSQL database with information about elements from the periodic table. The query can match an element by its atomic number, symbol, or name. If it finds a match, the script outputs a message with a collection of facts about the element from the database.
